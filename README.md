# Artificial Intelligence Labs
This repository contains course work completed as part of my course for the module **Artificial Intelligence**. The module is taught to undergraduate students at [GMIT](http://www.gmit.ie/) in the Department of Computer Science and Applied Physics for the course [B.S.c. (Hons) in Software Developement.](https://www.gmit.ie/software-development/bachelor-science-honours-software-development)
The lecturer is John Healy.

## Contains code for the following:
1. Fuzzy Logic
2. Uninformed Searches - BFS & DFS
3. Hill Climbing
4. Greedy Search
5. Beam Search
6. A* Search
7. Maze Generator
8. Perceptron
9. Multilayer Perceptron XOR
10. Nim Minimax
11. TicTacToe Minimax
12. Alpha-Beta Pruning
13. Backpropagation Neural Networks
14. Neural Network - Signals
15. Neural Network - Game
16. Neural Network - Zoo
17. Neural Network - Image Identification

## How to run:
All the lab work bar **Fuzzy Logic** can simply be compiled and run. The Fuzzy Logic code requires the full jFuzzyLogic library available [here](http://jfuzzylogic.sourceforge.net/html/index.html).
